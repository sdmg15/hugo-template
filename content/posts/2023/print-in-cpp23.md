title: std::print in C++23

![](/img/print.webp#floatright)

I just realized that 2023 is almost over and I haven't posted about the most
important feature of C++23. Which feature is that, you might ask? Unlike C++20
which had a bunch of massive new features like modules, concepts and the third
one, C++23 feels incremental.

The C++23 feature I am referring to is, of course,
[`std::print`][1], modeled after `fmt::print` from [the {fmt} library][2].
It feels deceptively small but it took ~3 years to get through the C++ committee
and it changes the most important aspect of C++, the way we write Hello World:

```c++
#include <print>

int main() {
  std::print("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

[2]: https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt

`std::print` is fairly small in terms of the standard wording because it builds
on the foundation of C++20 [`std::format`][3]. It is also relatively easy to
implement with libc++ already shipping it in version 17:
[godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/5M4be4Kcs).

The API of `std::print` resembles that of `printf` but it has a number of
important advantages compared to both stdio and iostreams.

## Safety

`std::print` is fully type-safe with errors in format strings [caught at compile
time][5] by default. This eliminates the whole class of errors and a [common
source of vulnerabilities][4].

[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_format_string
[5]: http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/safe-formatting-api/

```c++
std::print("{:d}", "I am not a number"); // compile error
```

## Unicode

`std::print` provides portable Unicode support. All you need to do is make
sure that the string literal encoding is UTF-8. This is normally the default on
POSIX and on Windows/MSVC it is enabled with a single compiler switch, `/utf-8`.
It is a good idea to use `/utf-8` even if you don't need `std::print`.

For example ([godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/Ga4xE4sMf)):

```c++
#include <print>

int main() {
  std::print("Hello, {}!\n", "world");
  std::print("Olá, {}!\n", "Mundo");
  std::print("你好{}！\n", "世界");
}
```

prints:

```
Hello, world!
Olá, Mundo!
你好世界！
```

Neither stdio nor iostreams can be used to reliably print Unicode on Windows
and in fact very few languages do it correctly. One of notable exceptions is
Rust where `print!` works great with Unicode.

## Performance

Performance depends on the quality of implementation but there are important
factors that make `std::print` faster than its stdio and iostreams counterparts
by design:

* [More efficient argument passing mechanism][6] which is particularly
  beneficial for positional arguments.
* Locale-independent formatting by default. This has both reliability and
  performance implications.
* `std::print` can write directly to a C stream (`FILE`) bypassing the
  inefficient iostream buffering and extra synchronization.

Here are some [benchmark results][7] comparing {fmt}'s implementation of `print`
with other libraries:

| Library           | Method        | Run Time, s |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| libc              | printf        |   0.91      |
| libc++            | std::ostream  |   2.49      |
| {fmt} 9.1         | fmt::print    |   0.74      |

On this benchmark `fmt::print` is ~20% faster than `printf` from Apple's libc.

## Atomicity

Like in `printf`, parts of messages printed with `std::print` from multiple
threads don't interleave. In iostreams they can interleave unless you use C++20
`std::syncstream`.

## Binary size

Again, this depends on the quality of implementation, but once `std::print`
implementations are stable and moved from headers to libraries we can expect
compact per-call binary code. Here is an example from the paper that uses {fmt}
that has already been optimized for binary size:

```c++
void printf_test(const char* name) {
  printf("Hello, %s!", name);
}
```

As you can see the code generated for `print` is somewhere in between `printf`
and `ostream`. Considering that `print`'s example adds runtime safety, error
handling and is more efficient, this seems like a reasonable tradeoff.

## What’s next?

Now that we provide a safe, extensible and efficient formatting output facility,
the next obvious frontier is formatted input. It poses a completely different
set of challenges but we could apply some of the lessons from the `std::format`
and `std::print` work. If you are interested in formatted input, check out
the excellent [scnlib library](https://github.com/eliaskosunen/scnlib) by
Elias Kosunen.

## What took you so long?

I was too young to be involved with C++ 38 years ago so I don't have full
context but the `print` function in almost its current form has been available
in the {fmt} library (called C++ Format back then) since [version 0.10.0][10]
released 9.5 years ago. I intentionally didn't include I/O in the `std::format`
proposal to keep the scope manageable. It took extra 3 years for `std::print`
mostly because Unicode on Windows is very broken due to layers of legacy
codepages.
