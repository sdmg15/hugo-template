<p>AMPL has supported <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming">constraint
programming</a> since early 2000s when the paper <a href=
"http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~4er/WRITINGS/extmodcp.pdf">Extending an
Algebraic Modeling Language to Support Constraint Programming</a> was
published. This work has been recently resumed with an update to <a href=
"https://github.com/vitaut/ampl/tree/master/solvers/ilogcp">ilogcp</a>, the
AMPL driver for <a href=
"http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-cp-optimizer/">
IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer</a> (yes, that's how it is called), and more work
in this direction is underway. In this post I will show how to build the
ilogcp driver and use it with AMPL to solve constraint programming
models.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now you can download the ilogcp driver from
<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/LOGIC/index.html">the AMPL website</a>, so
you don't have to build it yourself.</p>

<p>The source code is available in <a href=
"https://github.com/vitaut/ampl">this AMPL GitHub repository</a> which you
can get using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>:</p>

<pre class="terminal"><code>$ git clone git://github.com/vitaut/ampl.git</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you can download the source using one of these archives:
<a href="https://github.com/vitaut/ampl/tarball/master">tar.gz</a>, <a href=
"https://github.com/vitaut/ampl/zipball/master">zip</a>.</p>

  <p>Apart from the source code you'll also need a recent version of CPLEX
  Studio and development tools (a C/C++ compiler and make on Linux and Mac,
  Visual C++ on Windows) installed on your machine. The easiest way to build
  the source code is with <a href=
  "http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">CMake</a>.</p>

  <p>The build process is fairly straightforward especially if you have CPLEX
  Studio installed in the default location:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <code>ampl</code> directory containing the source code.</li>

    <li>Run <code>cmake .</code> to generate native makefiles or build
    projects.</li>

    <li>If you use a Linux/UNIX system, you should now see a Makefile in the
    current directory. Now you can build the binaries by running
    <code>make</code>. If you use Windows and have Vistual Studio installed,
    an AMPL.sln file and several .vcproj files will be created. You can build
    them using Visual Studio.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once the build is complete you should have the driver executable called
  <code>ilogcp</code> in the <code>solvers/ilogcp</code> folder. Just put it in
  the same folder with other ampl binaries and you are good to go.</p>

  <p>As an example let's consider a classical <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic">verbal arithmetic</a> puzzle
  SEND+MORE=MONEY by Henry Dudeney. As in other puzzles of this kind you need
  to find distinct digits to replace the letters such that the equation holds.
  In addition the most significant digit of each number shouldn't be zero. This
  can be easily modeled as a constraint programming problem in AMPL:</p>

<pre>
set Letters;
var d{Letters} >= 0 <= 9 integer;

s.t. nonzeroS: d['S'] != 0;
s.t. nonzeroM: d['M'] != 0;

s.t. equation:     1000 * d['S'] + 100 * d['E'] + 10 * d['N'] + d['D'] +
                   1000 * d['M'] + 100 * d['O'] + 10 * d['R'] + d['E'] =
  10000 * d['M'] + 1000 * d['O'] + 100 * d['N'] + 10 * d['E'] + d['Y'];

s.t. different: alldiff{l in Letters} d[l];

data;
set Letters := S E N D M O R Y;
</pre>

<a href=
"https://raw.github.com/vitaut/ampl/master/models/logic/send-more-money.mod">Download
the model</a>

  <p>Variable <code>d</code> gives the mapping between letters an digits. The
  <code>nonzeroS</code> and <code>nonzeroM</code> constraints state that
  <code>S</code> and <code>M</code> shouldn't be zero (as they represent the
  most significant digits). The <code>equation</code> constraint encodes the
  main equation that should hold. It might be a bit more compact if we used a
  separate variable for each letter. Finally the <code>different</code>
  constraint which specifies that the all the variables <code>d</code> should
  take different values.</p>

  <p>Let's load the model into AMPL:</p>

<pre>
ampl: model money.mod;
money.mod, line 6 (offset 148):
 Caution: Treating strict inequality constraint as a logical constraint.
context:  s.t. nonzeroS: d['S'] !=  >>> 0; <<<

money.mod, line 7 (offset 176):
 Caution: Treating strict inequality constraint as a logical constraint.
context:  s.t. nonzeroM: d['M'] !=  >>> 0; <<<
</pre>

<p>AMPL gives you a couple of warnings about the logical constraints. These
warnings might be useful since most of the solvers don't know how to deal with
such constraints but in this case you can safely ignore them. Now let's change
the solver to <code>ilogcp</code>, solve the problem and display the solution:</p>

<pre>
ampl: option solver ilogcp;
ampl: solve;
ilogcp 12.4.0: feasible solution
289 choice points, 309 fails
ampl: display d;
d [*] :=
D  7
E  5
M  1
N  6
O  0
R  8
S  9
Y  2
;
</pre>

<p>You can find additional information such as the solver options supported
by the ilogcp driver in the <a href=
"https://raw.github.com/vitaut/ampl/master/solvers/ilogcp/README">README
file</a>. The AMPL's constraint programming constructs and their mapping to
the corresponding Concert API elements are documented <a href=
"http://vitaut.github.com/ampl/solvers/ilogcp/usage.html">here</a>.</p>
