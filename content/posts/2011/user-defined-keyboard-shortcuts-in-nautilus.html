<p>In this post I describe how to add arbitrary keyboard shortcuts to the
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus">Nautilus</a> file manager using its
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python/">extension API</a>. I
really like Nautilus, it has a clean interface and lots of features under the
hood. One of the things I was missing coming from the world of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers">orthodox
file managers</a> was an embedded terminal which can be shown/hidden with a
simple keyboard shorcut. Recently there appeared an extension called <a href=
"http://software.flogisoft.com/nautilus-terminal/en/">Nautilus Terminal</a>
that provides exactly this. It is quite good and I highly recommend to give
it a try. However I was not entirely satisfied with it because of inability
to use some usual shortcuts such as <code>Ctrl+L</code>, although you can use
<code>Ctrl+Shift+L</code> instead. Also if you change a directory in Nautilus
the embedded terminal is closed and a new one is opened in a new location. So
you can't really have anything running in a terminal and at the same time
browse the directories.</p>

<p>After some googling I've found another nice extension called <a href=
"http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/nautilus-open-terminal">nautilus-open-terminal</a>
which allows to open a terminal through a context menu. It is not bad but I
would prefer a keyboard shortcut instead of the context menu. After some
experiments I've found a hackish way to implement this by (ab)using <a href=
"http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python/documentation/html/class-nautilus-python-location-widget-provider.html">
LocationWidgetProvider</a>. If you know a better way please tell me about it
in the comments section below.</p>

<p>So here is a Python script that does the trick:</p>

<pre>
import gconf, gtk, nautilus, os, pipes, urllib
 
TERMINAL_KEY = '/desktop/gnome/applications/terminal/exec'
 
class ShortcutProvider(nautilus.LocationWidgetProvider):
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = gconf.client_get_default()
        self.accel_group = gtk.AccelGroup()
        self.accel_group.connect_group(
           ord('o'), gtk.gdk.CONTROL_MASK, gtk.ACCEL_VISIBLE,
           self.run_terminal)
        self.window = None
 
    def run_terminal(self, accel_group, acceleratable,
                     keyval, modifier):
        filename = urllib.unquote(self.uri[7:])
        terminal = self.client.get_string(TERMINAL_KEY)
        os.chdir(filename)
        os.system(pipes.quote(terminal) + ' &')
        return True
 
    def get_widget(self, uri, window):
        self.uri = uri
        if self.window:
            self.window.remove_accel_group(self.accel_group)
        window.add_accel_group(self.accel_group)
        self.window = window
        return None
</pre>

<p>To enable this extension first install the python-nautilus package
(<code>sudo apt-get install python-nautilus</code> in Ubuntu), then copy the
script to the extensions install path, e.g.
<code>~/.nautilus/python-extensions/</code> and restart nautilus with the
<code>nautilus -q</code> command. This script redefines the <code>Ctrl+O</code>
shortcut to open a terminal. It can be easily adjusted to use a different key
combination or to define several shortcuts with different actions. For
example <a href=
"https://github.com/vitaut/captain-nemo/raw/master/misc/shortcut.py">this
script</a> defines <code>Ctrl+O</code> to open a terminal and <code>Ctrl-G</code>
to open gitg in the current directory of Nautilus. It also adds Compareâ€¦ to
the context menu when two files are selected.
</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've ported the script to Nautilus 3. The new
version can be downloaded from <a href=
"https://github.com/vitaut/captain-nemo/raw/master/misc/shortcut-nautilus3.py">
here</a>. Note that the script requires at least version 1.0-0ubuntu2 of the
python-nautilus package.</p>
