Ease of use has always been one of the main features of
[C++ Format](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat). You only need to add two files,
`format.h` and `format.cc` to your project in order to start using the library.
And now C++ Format is available on major Linux distributions and Homebrew on OS X
so you can install it on your system with a package manager. Here is a possibly
incomplete list of supported systems:

* Debian:
  [stretch](https://packages.debian.org/source/stretch/cppformat),
  [sid](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/cppformat)
* [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cppformat)
* [Fedora](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/cppformat/)
* [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cppformat/) (user repository)
* [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Cppformat)

Thanks go to the following people

* Anatoliy Bulukin for a Homebrew formula
* Dave Johansen for Fedora and RHEL packaging
* Eugene V. Lyubimkin for Debian packaging
* Xentec for Arch Linux packaging

Special thanks to Eugene V. Lyubimkin and Dave Johansen who suggested a number of
improvements and submitted bug reports and patches. Due to their help, the library
is now compatible with a wide range of platforms including ARM, ppc64, ppc64le and
s390x.

Since I'm an Ubuntu user myself, I'll show how to install C++ Format in the
recently released Ubuntu 15.10 [Wily Werewolf](http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.10/).
First you need to enable the Universe repository if you haven't done it before:

```
$ sudo apt-add-repository universe && sudo apt-get update
```

Then you can install the library with `apt-get`:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libcppformat1-dev
```

To check that it works let's create a small example:

```c++
// test.cc
#include <cppformat/format.h>

int main() {
  fmt::print("The answer is {}.\n", 42);
}
```

compile and run it:

```
$ g++ -otest test.cc -lcppformat
$ ./test
The answer is 42.
```

As you can see everything works as expected.

If you know about other distributions that support C++ Format, please let me know
in the comments section below.
