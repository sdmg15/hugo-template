Constraint Programming in AMPL

In this presentation, weâ€™ll give an overview of constraint programming features
in the AMPL modeling system. AMPL is an efficient, multi-platform modeling system
based on a high-level algebraic modeling language. It facilitates rapid development
of optimization models and integration of this models into applications. AMPL
supports a large variety of solvers and provides streamlined database access.

Originally developed in mid 90s, constraint programming extensions of AMPL enable
the use of sophisticated modeling constructs such as logical constraints, counting
operators and all-different constraints in addition to algebraic constraints in an
optimization model. This allows natural formulation of many combinatorial
optimization models.

Unlike most other general-purpose modeling systems, AMPL supports multiple CP solvers
through an open solver interface. This interface is specifically designed to make
connecting new solvers easy and facilitates testing of solver drivers using a
common test suite.

AMPL is currently connected to the latest versions of three popular constraint
programming solvers IBM/ILOG CP Optimizer, Gecode and JaCoP.
