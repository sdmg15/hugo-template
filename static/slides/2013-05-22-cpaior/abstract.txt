Connecting Constraint Solvers to AMPL

We describe a recent project to connect the AMPL optimization modeling language
to the constraint solvers IBM ILOG CP, Gecode and JaCoP. Our interfaces take
advantage of logical forms such as constraint disjunctions, counting operators,
and all-different constraints that were introduced into AMPL in the 1990s to
complement conventional algebraic equalities and inequalities; the availability
of these forms permits CP and MIP models to be solved and compared in the same
context. While general-purpose modeling languages have previously been connected
to constraint solvers, our work is distinguished by the AMPL language’s connections
to multiple CP solvers in addition to a broad variety of linear and nonlinear OR
solvers. Because CP solvers show a great diversity of interface requirements,
we incorporate new ideas for facilities to support conversion from AMPL’s general
expression-tree representation of logical constraints to the structures and calls
required by different solvers. A number of examples illustrate the use of AMPL's
logical forms in writing CP problems naturally and in trying them out on different
solver platforms.
