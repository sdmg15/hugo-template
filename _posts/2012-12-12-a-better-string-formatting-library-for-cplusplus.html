  <p>When I started learning C++ I kind of liked the <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_(C%2B%2B)">IOStreams</a> library.
  It was safe, <a href=
  "http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html">extensible</a>
  and could work with user-defined types. This compared favorably with the
  <code>printf</code> family of functions. However, as I started using C++ more
  and more in my daily job I found out that IOStreams had serious flaws.
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3176640/471164">This answer</a> on Stack
  Overflow nicely summarizes several issues with IOStreams:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Poor error handling</li>
    <li>Poor separation between formatting and I/O</li>
    <li>Poor support for i18n</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The popular <a href=
  "http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml">Google C++
  Style Guide</a> even permits the use of streams only for logging.</p>

  <p>So I started looking for a better solution and discovered the following
  libraries: <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/format/">Boost
  Format</a>, <a href=
  "http://loki-lib.sourceforge.net/html/a00666.html">SafeFormat</a>, <a href=
  "http://fastformat.sourceforge.net/">FastFormat</a> and <a href=
  "https://github.com/c42f/tinyformat">tinyformat</a>. Unfortunately neither of
  these entirely satisfied my needs so a few days ago when I was staying at
  home with cold I wrote <a href="https://github.com/vitaut/format">a new
  formatting library</a> which is small, type safe and close to
  <code>printf</code> in speed. In this and forthcoming posts I am going to
  describe its features and how this library compares to others.</p>

  <h3>Part 1. API</h3>

  <p>APIs of formatting libraries can be divided into two groups. The first
  group uses functions with variable number of arguments. It includes
  <code>printf</code> and friends, Fast Format and tinyformat. Here is an
  example using <code>printf</code>:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
printf("%s, %s %d\n", weekday, month, day);
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>One way to implement this kind of API is to use <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h">varargs</a>. This method is
  inherently unsafe because the type information is not available to the callee
  and it has to use some other mechanism such as a type field in a format
  string like <code>printf</code> does. Another possibility is to use <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_template">variadic templates</a> which
  unfortunately only available in C++11. For C++98 compatibility some libraries
  like tinyformat provide multiple versions of the same function with different
  number of arguments. The problem with this method is that it is difficult to
  define your own function that wraps a formatting function. Tinyformat
  provides a macro <a href=
  "https://github.com/c42f/tinyformat#wrapping-tfmformat-inside-a-user-defined-format-function">
  TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT</a> for this purpose which is used as follows:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
#undef TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT_EXTRA_ARGS
#define TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT_EXTRA_ARGS int code,
TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT(
  void,                                        /* return type */
  error,                                       /* function name */
  /*empty*/,                                   /* function declaration
                                                  suffix (eg, const) */
  std::cerr << "error (code " << code << ")";, /* stuff before
                                                  format()*/
  std::cerr,                                   /* stream name */
  /*empty*/                                    /* stuff after
                                                  format() */
  )
#undef TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT_EXTRA_ARGS
#define TINYFORMAT_WRAP_FORMAT_EXTRA_ARGS
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>This is obviously far from ideal so I rejected variadic functions in the
  core API although I am considering adding them in the future on top of existing
  interface.</p>

  <p>The second group of libraries uses overloaded operators such as
  <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> for passing arguments. It includes IOStreams,
  Boost Format and SafeFormat. They all use different operators:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
// IOStreams:
std::cout << weekday << ", " << month << " " << day << "\n";

// Boost Format:
std::string s = 
  str(boost::format("%1%, %2% %3%\n") % weekday % month % day);

// SafeFormat:
Loki::SPrintf(s, "%s, %d %d\n")(weekday)(month)(day);
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Instead of yet another arbitrary operator choice, I decided to use the
  conventional insertion operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code> since it is used by the
  standard streams:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
std::string s =
  str(fmt::Format("{0}, {1} {2}\n") << weekday << month << day);
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>As you can see the API is quite similar to Boost Format.
  <code>Format</code> is a function that takes a format string as an argument
  and returns a temporary object that accepts additional arguments via the
  operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. The <code>str</code> function converts the
  result into an <code>std::string</code>. There is also a <code>c_str</code>
  function that converts the result into a C string which can be useful for
  working with C code:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
rmdir(c_str(fmt::Format("{0}.lock") << pid));
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>So far this is similar to existing APIs. What is different is the ability
  to define your own functions that look exactly like <code>Format</code> but
  do additional things, for example:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
ReportError("File not found: {0}") << path;
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Let's say I want to define a function <code>ReportError</code> that
  formats and prints an error to <code>std::cerr</code> adding a newline. To
  this end I need to create a small class (struct will do since it has only one
  public member) that defines <code>operator()(const fmt::Writer &amp;)</code>
  which does the output:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
struct PrintError {
  void operator()(const fmt::Writer &w) const {
     std::cerr << "Error: " << w.str() << std::endl;
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

  <p><code>Writer</code> is a class that does all the formatting and stores
  the output in a buffer. The <code>str()</code> method converts the output to
  <code>std::string</code>, there are other access methods as well. Now I can
  define the <code>ReportError</code> function:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
fmt::Formatter<PrintError> ReportError(const char *format) {
  return fmt::Formatter<PrintError>(format);
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p><code>Formatter</code> is used only in wrapper functions like the
  one above. It is responsible for receiving arguments via <code>operator<<</code>,
  completing the format operation and calling a user supplied action like
  <code>PrintError</code> after that.</p>

  <p>As you can see creating wrappers is relatively easy. It doesn't require
  any preprocessor tricks or defining functions for different number of
  arguments. And once a wrapper function is defined it is as easy to use as
  <code>fmt::Format</code>, in fact the latter is implemented in exactly the
  same way.</p>

  <p>The <code>Writer</code> class can also be used on its own if you need
  to efficiently merge the output of multiple format operations, for
  example:</p>
{% highlight c++ %}
fmt::Writer out;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  out.Format("{0}") << i;
std::string s = out.str(); // s == 0123456789
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>This concludes the first and the most important part about the API. In the
  next part I am going to write about performance and related design
  aspects.</p>

  <p>The library is available in <a href=
  "https://github.com/vitaut/format">this repository</a> on GitHub. Feel free
  to use it and post your comments below.</p>
