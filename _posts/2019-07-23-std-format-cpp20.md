I'm happy to announce that the [Text Formatting proposal (`std::format`)](
https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html) made it into the C++20 Committee
Draft at the Cologne meeting, just in time before the feature freeze. This
concludes a three-year long design, implementation, and standardization effort.

Here's a brief history of the proposal aka "what took you so long?":

2016-08-17:
  - [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4y5zxf/formatting_functionality_in_the_standard_library/)
    floating the proposal idea

2016-08-27:
  - committed the [initial proposal draft on GitHub](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmtlib.github.io/blob/3c85511ca2665eed0e54cb598dd70b70e236ec0f/Text%20Formatting.html)

2017-07-10 to 15, Toronto, Canada:
  - presented revision 0 (R0 - as all sensible people we use zero-based revision
    numbers) of the proposal which received a positive feedback
  - was asked for compile-time processing of format strings, output
    iterator support, precomputing output size, and benchmark results
    (as you can see the committee loves to make you do more work - all of these
    features took months to design, implement, and turn into the paper form
    since I was working in my spare time, so I skipped one meeting)

2018-03-12 to 17, Jacksonville, USA:
  - presented R1
  - [Python-like syntax](https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html#Syntax) was
    approved (`{}` instead of `%`)
  - [user extensibility of syntax](https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html#Extensibility)
    was approved (important for date, time, and other nontrivial formatting,
    e.g. `format("{0:%Y-%m-%d}", t)`)
  - was asked for a function that formats to a sized range (`format_to_n`)

2018-06-04 to 09, Rapperswil, Switzerland:
  - presented R2
  - leaving the Unicode support for a separate paper was approved (ðŸ˜Œ Relieved
    Face)
  - nested namespace was dropped (`std::format` instead of `std::fmt::format` or
    similar)
  - the proposal was prioritized for the International Standard as opposed to
    going to the [Library Fundamentals Technical Specification](
    https://github.com/cplusplus/fundamentals-ts)
  - was asked to make the default floating-point format round trip

2018-11-05 to 10, San Diego, USA:
  - presented R4 (R3 was in the [post-Rapperswil mailing](
    http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/#mailing2018-06))
  - [type-erased API](https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html#Footprint) was
    approved (`std::vformat` that doesn't depend on argument types and gives you
    compact per-call binary code)
  - [specialization-based extension API](
    https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html#Extensibility) was approved
    (`std::formatter<T>`)
  - using the shortest correctly rounded decimal representation as the default
    floating-point format (expressed in terms of `std::to_chars`) was approved
  - the proposal was forwarded to the Library Working Group (LWG) for the
    wording (the text that goes into the standard) review
  - the wording was reviewed by LWG for the first time during its Saturday
    "zombie" session

2019-02-18 to 23, Kona, USA:
  - presented R5
  - obscure but important API improvements were approved 
  - forwarded back to LWG for C++20
  - survived extensive wording reviews of R7 (where did R6 go?) via multiple
    teleconferences after the meeting

2019-07-15 to 20, Cologne, Germany:
  - presented R9 (here I was told to stop bumping revisions between
    mailings, oops)
  - wording review and approval of the final revision
    [R10](https://fmt.dev/Text%20Formatting.html) that will be in the
    post-Cologne mailing

Contrary to the usual "design-by-committee" narrative, the standardization
process was tremendously beneficial both for the proposal and [the {fmt}
library](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), resulting in numerous improvements and
here are just a few examples:

* **Iterator support**

   The addition of iterator-based `std::format_to` and `std::format_to_n` functions
   makes formatting to arbitrary output targets such as arrays or containers
   as easy and natural as calling `std::copy` or `std::copy_n`:

   ```c++
   std::vector<char> buf;
   std::format_to(std::back_inserter(buf), "{}", 42);
   // buf contains "42"
   ```

   or 

   ```c++
   char buf[10];
   auto result = std::format_to_n(buf, sizeof(buf), "{}", 42);
   // buf contains "42" and result.out points to the end of the output.
   // No dynamic memory allocations.
   ```

* **Precomputing the output size**

   As the name suggests, `formatted_size` gives you the output size which
   could be useful for preallocating a buffer:

   ```c++
   auto size = std::formatted_size("{}", 42); // size == 2
   std::vector<char> buf(size);
   std::format_to(buf.data(), "{}", 42);
   ```

* **Compile-time processing of format string**

   Although not exposed through the top-level API yet, the design and the
   extension API fully support `constexpr` format string parsing which also
   applies to user-defined types. This required separation of parser and
   formatter contexts that hold parsing and formatting state respectively and
   generally resulted in a cleaner API:

   ```c++
   struct std::formatter<MyType> {
      constexpr auto parse(parse_context& ctx) {
        // Parses the format string range [ctx.begin(), ctx.end()).
        // Can be omitted if inherited from another formatter.
      }

      auto format(const MyType& value, format_context& ctx) {
        // Formats value and writes into ctx.out().
        // Can be delegated to another formatter.
      }
   };
   ```
   
   This will allow compile-time format string checks and even translating your
   format strings into formatter objects and eliminating any runtime overhead
   (which is usually pretty small though).

* **Default representation of floating-point numbers**

   Building upon C++17's [`std::to_chars`](
   https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/to_chars) and following the example
   of Python 3's `str.format`, `std::format` provides the shortest
   correctly-rounded floating point representation as the default. In particular
   this means, that unlike with `printf`, there is no precision loss:

   ```c++
   auto s = std::format("{}", M_PI); // s == "3.141592653589793"
   char buf[20];
   sprintf(buf, "%g", M_PI);         // buf contains "3.14159"
   ```

In addition to the P0645 Text Formatting there were several other formatting
papers approved at Cologne:

1. [P1361 Integration of chrono with text formatting](
   https://github.com/vitaut/wg21/blob/master/generated/D1361R2.pdf) written in
   collaboration with Daniela Engert and Howard E. Hinnant. This paper makes it
   possible to format all chrono types with `std::format` and removes now
   redundant `std::chrono::format`. Among other things, formatting multiple
   objects in one go becomes much easier:

   ```c++
   void print_birthday(std::string_view name,
                       const std::chrono::year_month_day& birthday) {
     std::cout << std::format("{0}'s birthday is {1:%Y-%m-%d}.\n", name, birthday);
   }
   ```

   and you can avoid dynamic memory allocations:

   ```c++
   std::array<char, 100> buf;
   std::format_to_n(buf.data(), buf.size(), "{:%Y-%m-%d}", date);
   ```

2. [P1652 Printf corner cases in `std::format`](
   http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1652r0.html)
   written by Zhihao Yuan. This paper contains a number of critical bug fixes
   for P0645 Text Formatting. For example, it makes formatting of `float`
   round trip (previously `float` was converted to `double` as in `printf`):

   ```c++
   std::string s = std::format("{}", 3.31f); // s == "3.31"
   ```
   Without the fix `s` would contain "3.309999942779541".

3. [P1636 Formatters for library types](https://wg21.link/p1636r0) by
   Lars Gullik BjÃ¸nnes. This paper makes a number of standard library types
   such as `std::complex` and `std::filesystem::path` formattable with
   `std::format`, e.g.

   ```c++
   auto s = std::format("{}", 1 + 2i); // s == (1, 2)
   ```
   
   It was approved by the Library Evolution Working Group
   that deals with the design and API, but there was no wording review yet.

## What's next?

P0645 has built the foundation for modern, efficient, and extensible text
formatting. However, due to time constraints it left unanswered a number of
questions that will be addressed by future proposals:

* **Unicode support**: we need to provide formatting functions that work with
  `char8_t` and other Unicode unit and corresponding string types,
  correctly handling format specifications expressed in more high-level terms
  than code units.

* **Compile-time format strings**: as mentioned earlier, the extension API is
  `constexpr`-ready but we need a convenient top-level API to make use of it.

* **Formatted I/O**: it would be nice to have a better integration between
  formatting and I/O than just passing strings around as in

  ```c++
  std::cout << std::format("The answer is {}.", 42);
  ```

## FAQ

**Q**: I want to use this now, not wait until C++20 is available and `std::format`
is implemented in my standard library. What should I do?

**A**: All of this and much more has been implemented in [the {fmt} library](
https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) which works on pretty much anything that
considers itself a C++ compiler.
