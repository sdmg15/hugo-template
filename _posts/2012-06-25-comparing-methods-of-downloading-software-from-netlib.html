<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<div class='post'>
  <p><a href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib</a> is a repository for
  mathematical software such as <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas">BLAS</a>,
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack">LAPACK</a> and, most importantly =),
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/ampl">AMPL Solver Library (ASL)</a>. The
  software can be retrieved using a number of protocols and as I found out the
  download speed can vary greatly. For example, it took me 10 minutes to
  retrieve entire ASL by FTP using <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> while other options can reduce
  this time to tens of seconds. This was the reason why I decided to do this
  small comparison of different methods to retrieve software from Netlib.</p>

  <p>So the slowest way is to retrieve individual files by <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>:</p>
{% highlight text %}
$ time wget --recursive ftp://netlib.org/ampl
...
Total wall clock time: 10m 9s
Downloaded: 880 files, 45M in 2m 26s (317 KB/s)

real 10m8.855s
user 0m0.804s
sys 0m3.704s
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>It turned out that a much faster method is to use <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> instead
  of FTP. This is a complete surprise to me, considering that FTP was designed
  for file transfer. Maybe its just an issue with wget? If you have any ideas
  please let me know in the comment section below.</p>

{% highlight text %}
$ time wget --recursive --include-directories=ampl \
    http://www.netlib.org/ampl
...
Total wall clock time: 1m 59s
Downloaded: 714 files, 41M in 30s (1.37 MB/s)

real 1m58.986s
user 0m0.476s
sys 0m2.856s
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>--include-directories=ampl</code> option ensures that only the
content of the <code>ampl</code> directory is downloaded and files in other
locations referred from html files are ignored.</p>

  <p>However there is even a faster method which relies on Netlib ability to
  provide whole directories as compressed files:</p>

{% highlight text %}
$ time wget ftp://netlib.org/ampl.tar.gz
...
real 0m49.365s
user 0m0.320s
sys 0m1.908s
{% endhighlight %}

  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">Rsync</a> is yet another
  method almost as fast as downloading compressed directories by FTP:</p>

{% highlight text %}
$ time rsync -avz netlib.org::netlib/ampl .
...
real 0m53.467s
user 0m0.860s
sys 0m2.512s
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Putting it all together: <script src="https://www.google.com/jsapi" type=
  "text/javascript"></script> <script type="text/javascript">
    google.load("visualization", "1", {packages:["corechart"]});       google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);       function drawChart() {         var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([           ['Method', 'Time, seconds'],           ['FTP recursive',  608.855],           ['HTTP',  118.986],           ['FTP tar.gz',  49.365],           ['rsync',  53.467],           ['FileZilla', 348]         ]);          var options = {           title: 'Comparison of Download Methods',           vAxis: {title: 'Method',  titleTextStyle: {color: 'red'}}         };          var chart = new google.visualization.BarChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));         chart.draw(data, options);       }     
  </script></p>

  <div id="chart_div" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;"></div>

  <p>The conclusion is simple: using rsync or retrieving compressed directories
  by FTP are by far the fastest methods of downloading from Netlib. Recursive
  HTTP download is more than two times slower and recursive FTP is painfully
  slow.</p>

  <p><strong>Update:</strong> found possible explanation of poor performance of
  recursive FTP <a href=

    Retrieving a single file from an FTP server involves an unbelievable number
    of back-and-forth handshaking steps.

      I think the link in your update accounts for this. Most of the steps
      listed there are done once per session, but I had forgotten that each
      file is transfered on a separate socket, with additional handshakes. That
      also suggests, though, that if you FTP client and the server can agree on
      enough simultaneous data channels, FTP might be faster than HTTP.

      I don't think that the problem is in the FTP service being overloaded,
      because I tried it at different times with almost identical results.
      Besides FTP performs fine when retrieving archives. I think that the main
      issue is the number of roundtrips required to retrieve each file and
      large number of files (~900 in the ampl dir). Unfortunately my ftp client
      doesn't support recursive mget. I've tried FileZilla (see the updated
      chart) and it was roughly twice as fast as recursive FTP. I think this is
      because it uses two concurrent transfers by default. Still much slower
      than rsync or getting a gzipped tarball by FTP.

      I too am surprised by your results. Maybe the FTP service was more
      heavily loaded than the web service? Also, did you try command-line FTP
      (with mget) or a client such as FileZilla?
