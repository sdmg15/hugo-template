I was recently asked on GitHub why would someone use
[`fmt::printf`](http://cppformat.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference.html#printf-formatting-functions),
which is a part of the [C++ Format library](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat),
over the standard C library `printf`.
This is a fair question and so I decided to write this blog post comparing the two.

Disclaimer: I'm the author of C++ Format, so this is all very biased =).

Whenever I mention `printf` without a namespace in this post I mean the whole family of `printf`
functions from the C standard library, including `sprintf` and `fprintf`. The C++ Format library
includes its own implementation of `printf` which resides in the `fmt` namespace, so I'll use
qualified name `fmt::printf` to distinguish it from the standard one.

Safety
------

The main difference between `printf` and C++ Format is the way they accept formatting
arguments.

`printf` uses the mechanism provided by the C language sometimes referred to
as [varargs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function). This mechanism is
inherently unsafe because it relies on the user to handle the type information which,
in the case of `printf`, is encoded in the format string together with formatting
options. GCC provides an extension,
[\_\_attribute\_\_((format (printf, ...))](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html),
that partially addresses safety issues. However, this only works with
format strings that are string literals which is not always the case especially
when strings are localized. Also not all C and C++ compilers support this attribute.

C++ Format uses [variadic templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_template)
introduces in C++11 and emulates them on older compilers. This ensures complete type
safety. Mismatch between the format specification and the actual type causes an exception
while in `printf` it often leads to a segfault.

Here's a small artificial example that illustrates the problem:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  const char *format_str = "%s";
  printf(format_str, format_str[0]);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's compile and run it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic test.cc
$ ./a.out 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that GCC doesn't even give a warning with `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`.

As was pointed out in one of the comments on Reddit, you can get a warning with
`-Wformat-nonliteral`. As the name suggests, this will only warn you that
the format string is nonliteral.

Here's the C++ Format version:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include "format.h"

int main() {
  const char *format_str = "%s";
  try {
    fmt::printf(format_str, format_str[0]);
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    fmt::printf("%s\n", e.what());
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's compile and run it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ g++ test.cc
$ ./a.out 
unknown format code 's' for integer
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the error is reported as an exception that can be safely catched
and handled. C++ Format doesn't do compile-time checking of literal format strings
though.

Extensibility
-------------

It is often said that `printf` is not extensible and doesn't support user-defined types.
This is not entirely true as the GNU C Library provides some
[extension mechanisms](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Customizing-Printf.html).
However, as with attributes, they are not standard.

The current version of C++ Format can format any type that provides overloaded
`operator<<` in addition to all built-in types, for example:

{% highlight c++ %}
class Date {
  int year_, month_, day_;
 public:
  Date(int year, int month, int day) : year_(year), month_(month), day_(day) {}

  friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Date &d) {
    return os << d.year_ << '-' << d.month_ << '-' << d.day_;
  }
};

std::string s = fmt::format("The date is {}", Date(2012, 12, 9));
// s == "The date is 2012-12-9"
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the above example uses Python-like
[format string syntax](http://cppformat.readthedocs.org/en/stable/syntax.html)
which is also supported (and recommended) by C++ Format.

Since C++ Format manages type information automatically, you don't have to
encode it in the format string as with `printf`, so the same default format
specifier `{}` can be used with objects of any type. This can also result in
shorter format strings as format specifiers like `hh` or `ll` are not required
any more.

Performance
-----------

The current version of C++ Format library is
[much faster on integer formatting](http://zverovich.net/2013/09/07/integer-to-string-conversion-in-cplusplus.html),
but not as fast on floating-point formatting
[compared to EGLIBC](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat#speed-tests).
The library relies on `snprintf` for floating-point formatting
and does some additional processing to ensure consistent output across platforms.
This will be improved in the next version.

Portability
-----------

Being part of the C standard library, `printf` is available pretty much everywhere,
but the quality of implementations widely vary and there are inconsistencies
between output on different platforms especially with floating-point numbers.

C++ Format has been tested on all major platforms and compilers. It provides consistent
output across platforms and implements POSIX extensions for positional arguments
that are not available in some `printf` implementations.

Compiled code size
------------------

According to the [code bloat benchmark](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat#compile-time-and-code-bloat),
C++ Format adds about 10% to the optimized code size compared to `printf`.
The additional size comes from the type information that is passed alongside
the formatting arguments.

In practice, increase in binary size when switching
from `printf` to C++ Format is small and, of course, depends on amount of
formatting done by the application. For example, when [0 A.D.](http://play0ad.com/)
switched to C++ Format, they reported only 3% increase in binary size on older
version of the library (statically linked) which was more affected by code bloat.
On the current version it would be even smaller.

Memory management
-----------------

Memory management is related to safety, but I think it deserves a separate section
not to mix with type safety issues.

[`sprintf`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/sprintf) relies on the user
to provide large enough buffer which may easily result in buffer overflow.
This issue is addressed in `snprintf` where you can pass buffer size.
Unfortunately, it is rather awkward to use if you want to grow your buffer
dynamicaly to accommodate large output as the following example taken from
the [`snprintf` manpage](http://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf) nicely illustrates:

{% highlight c++ %}
char *
make_message(const char *fmt, ...)
{
    int n;
    int size = 100;     /* Guess we need no more than 100 bytes */
    char *p, *np;
    va_list ap;
    if ((p = malloc(size)) == NULL)
        return NULL;
    while (1) {
       /* Try to print in the allocated space */
       va_start(ap, fmt);
        n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
        va_end(ap);

       /* Check error code */
       if (n < 0)
            return NULL;

       /* If that worked, return the string */
       if (n < size)
            return p;

       /* Else try again with more space */
       size = n + 1;       /* Precisely what is needed */
       if ((np = realloc (p, size)) == NULL) {
            free(p);
            return NULL;
        } else {
            p = np;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

C++ Format allocates buffer on stack if the output is small enough and
uses dynamic memory allocation for larger output. This is all done automatically
without user intervention. For example, in the following code everything is
allocated on stack:

{% highlight c++ %}
fmt::MemoryWriter w;
w.write("Look, a {} string", 'C');
w.c_str(); // returns a C string (const char*)
{% endhighlight %}

If necessary you can specify a
[custom allocator](http://cppformat.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference.html#custom-allocators)
to be used for large output.

Conclusion
----------

The C++ Format library provides safe extensible alternative to the C `printf` family
of functions with comparable (better on integer formatting) performance and compiled
code size.

**Update**: added Memory management section
