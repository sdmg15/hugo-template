================

With the start of a new year I think it's about time to look at the
[NEOS Server](http://www.neos-server.org/neos/) statistics for 2012.
So I wrote a small [IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebook that
extracts the information from
[NEOS Solver Access Statistics](http://www.neos-server.org/neos/report.html)
and here are the results.

Gurobi has become number one solver on NEOS in 2012 which is not
surprising (for me). Interestingly, top NEOS solvers are either nonlinear
or mixed integer or both.

Modelling languages continue to dominate as in a
[similar report made by Erwin Kalvelagen in 2009](http://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.com/2009/11/neos-statistics.html),
with AMPL being the most widely used input format.
AMPL and GAMS together account for more than 90% of submissions.

The IPython notebook which I used to extract statistics from NEOS
is available [here](https://github.com/vitaut/neos-stats).
