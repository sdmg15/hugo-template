{{ page.title }}
================

2013 is over so it's time to report the annual [NEOS Server](http://www.neos-server.org/neos/)
statistics again.

The results are very different from the
[previous year](http://zverovich.net/2013/01/01/neos-statistics-for-2012.html).
AMPL is now used in almost 90% of all submissions, a large increase from ~57% in 2012.
The use of low-level formats such as MPS decreased to less than 4%, down from ~10%
the year before.

Top three positions in the solver category are now occupied by nonlinear solvers,
MINOS, MINLP and KNITRO.

The IPython notebook which I used to extract statistics from NEOS
is available [here](https://github.com/vitaut/neos-stats).
I have updated it to make the start and end date configurable.
