<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class='post'>
I have finally integrated my Picasa photos that are now available on the <a href="/p/Photos.html">Photos</a> page. Blogger doesn't seem to allow you to host anything other than HTML, so I had to host my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/picasa-app/">picasa-app</a> scripts that do the integration externally. To this end I enabled cross-site deployment in picasa-app which was a matter of changing the linker from <code>std</code> to <code>xs</code>. When viewing the photos, there are some glitches related to z-order which I am going to look at later.</div>
