In this post I compare the performance of several methods
of integer to string conversion in C++:

* [`sprintf`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf)
* [`std::stringstream`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream)
* [`std::to_string`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string) from C++11
* `boost::format` from the [Boost Format library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/format/)
* [`boost::lexical_cast`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/boost_lexical_cast.html)
* `karma::generate` from the [Boost Spirit Parser framework](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/index.html)
* `fmt::format_int`, `fmt::format`, `fmt::format_to` and `fmt::compile` from
  the [{fmt} library](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
* [Public-domain `ltoa`](http://www8.cs.umu.se/~isak/snippets/ltoa.c) implementation
* [`decimal_from`](http://ideone.com/nrQfA8) function suggested by Alf P. Steinbach

To measure the performance I used a
[benchmark from Boost Karma](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/karma/performance_measurements/numeric_performance/int_performance.html).
This benchmark generates 10,000,000 random integers and converts them to strings
using different methods measuring conversion time. I've replaced nonportable
`itoa` with `sprintf` and added several other methods.

Apart from adding new conversion methods, I've also noticed that the benchmark
used unnecessary conversion to `std::string` in some tests
to compensate for string operations in the other. To get more useful results,
I've split every such test in two, one that does conversion to `std::string` and
one that doesn't. Tests that do unnecessary conversion to `std::string` have suffix
`+std::string`. They are suboptimal, but I've included them for completeness.

Here are the results ordered by the time it took a method to convert 10,000,000
integers to strings (obviously smaller is better); time ratio is the ratio of
conversion time to the best time:

<div id="table_div">
</div>
<div style="height: 400px" id="chart_div">
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/files/2013-09-stats.js"></script>

I consider these results pretty exciting. First they show that `fmt::format_int`
is the fastest of the tested methods, about 24% faster than
`cppx::decimal_from`, the next contender, and whopping 30x (not 30%) faster than
boost::format. Here's the code to convert an integer to a string with
`fmt::format_int`:

{% highlight c++ %}
fmt::format_int f(42);
// The result can be converted to std::string using s.str() or
// accessed as a C string using s.c_str().
auto s = f.c_str(); // s == "42"
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `fmt::format_int` automatically manages the output buffer unlike
`sprintf` and `karma::generate` which require an error-prone manual memory
management. In the case of `karma::generate` you can probably use an output
iterator such as `back_insert_iterator` for automatic memory management but the
performance will likely suffer.

Another remarkable and surprising (to me) observation is that
`sprintf` is not particularly good for integer formatting. It is more than 6
times slower than `fmt::format_int`. One possible reason for this is that
`sprintf` parses the format string, but so do `fmt::format` and `fmt::format_to`
which are 1.8 - 2.6 times faster than `sprintf`. The good thing is that you
don't have to use `sprintf` in an attempt to sacrifice safety for performance.
There are much faster or at least equally slow but safer methods.

One recent addition to the benchmark is `fmt::compile` which does `constexpr`
format string compilation. As can be seen from the results `fmt::compile` +
`fmt::format_to` give the performance almost as good a that of an artisanal
integer-to-string converter optimized by hand (`cppx::decimal_from`).

The benchmark results were obtained on macOS Mojave with Apple LLVM version
10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4) and the following compiler flags: `-O3 -DNDEBUG`.

Running the benchmark:

{% highlight text %}
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/vitaut/format-benchmark.git
$ cd format-benchmark
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./int-generator-test.py
{% endhighlight %}

You can find out more about `fmt::format_int` and `fmt::format` in the [{fmt}
library repository](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) on GitHub and in the
[documentation](http://fmt.dev/).

**Update:**
Since I don't have `ltoa` on my platform, I've added a basic
public-domain implementation of this function from
[here](http://www8.cs.umu.se/~isak/snippets/ltoa.c). Let me know in the
comment section if there is a better version available somewhere.

**Update 2:**
Added [decimal_from](http://ideone.com/nrQfA8) function suggested by Alf P. Steinbach.
It has approximately the same performance as `fmt::Writer`, the difference of 0.5% is
probably less than the measurement error. In some runs it is even marginally faster.
As `sprintf` and `ltoa` and unlike `fmt::Writer` it requires preallocated buffer.

**Update 3:**
Inspired by a lesson learned from Alexandrescu's talk that "no work is less work than
some work" I've come up with a faster method of integer to string conversion. Unlike
other methods it does one pass over the digits. All other methods I know do two passes
and can be divided into two categories:

1. Count digits (pass 1), then convert digits to chars writing from the end of the
   buffer (pass 2).
2. Convert digits to chars writing from the beginning of the buffer (pass 1).
   Reverse the string in the buffer (pass 2).

Instead of doing this, I just convert digits to chars writing from the end of the
buffer and return the pointer to the start of the converted string. In most cases
there is some space left in the beginning of the buffer, but that's fine because
the same is true for the second category of methods above, they just have this
space at the end of the buffer. This avoids unnecessary copying within a buffer
that is discarded anyway.

I've implemented this method in the `fmt::format_int` class which can be used as follows:

{% highlight c++ %}
fmt::format_int(42).str();   // convert to std::string
fmt::format_int(42).c_str(); // convert and get as a C string
                             // (mind the lifetime, same as std::string::c_str())
{% endhighlight %}

I've updated the test results and as you can see it is about 30% faster than the
previous winner, `fmt::Writer`.

**Update 4:**

Added side effects to make sure that the code being tested is not optimized
away by a super clever compiler (I wish there existed one). This is implemented
by computing a sum of lengths of all formatted strings using strlen. 
The strlen function is used even in cases where std::string::size could be used
to make sure the same extra computation is done for all methods. Note that since
this adds a more or less constant factor to all the methods, high performers are
penalized more.

**Update 5:**

Fixed links to the fmt library.

**Update 6 (25 Nov 2019):**

Added `fmt::compile` which does constexpr format string compilation and updated
the test results.
