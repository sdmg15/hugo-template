The AMPL Interface to Constraint Programming Solvers

Algebraic modeling languages in general and AMPL in particular are widely used in combinatorial
or discrete optimization, but their application has often been limited to modeling mixedÂ­integer
programming problems. At the same time AMPL has a long history of supporting more general
types of problems and optimization constructs.

Constraint programming (CP) allows a more natural representation of many combinatorial
constructs. The constraint programming extensions of AMPL have been available since mid 90s
and a number of extensions to other modeling languages has been proposed due to increasing
popularity of this methodology.

In this talk we describe the AMPL interface to constraint programming solvers. Since a general-
purpose modeling language normally supports different solvers, we address the challenges of
accommodating a variety of solver needs. We also describe recent developments in CP solver
support in AMPL.
