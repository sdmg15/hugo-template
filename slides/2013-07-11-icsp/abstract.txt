Title: A solver for problems with second-order stochastic dominance constraints
Keywords: second-order stochastic dominance, solver, asset allocation, ampl

Stochastic dominance provides an important framework of making choice; it is
applied increasingly in asset allocation decisions which take into account risk.
In particular, second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) captures risk-averse
preferences; this is a fundamental assumption underlying investment behaviour.
It is established as a theoretically sound choice criterion in portfolio
selection models.

We describe the architecture and implementation of a solver for problems with
second-order stochastic dominance constraints. The solver provides an efficient
implementation of cutting-plane methods proposed in F치bi치n, Mitra, and Roman
(2009) and F치bi치n, Mitra, Roman, and Zverovich (2010). These methods have been
shown to process problems with a large number of scenarios efficiently and allow
regularization by the level method of Lemarechal et al. (1995). The SSD solver
described by us can be called from AMPL and other modeling systems that support
AMPL solver interface.

We illustrate the use of the solver for an exemplar portfolio selection model
and report computational results showing that it can solve efficiently very
large problems.
